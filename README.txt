This file describes the file structure of our Homework 2:

- In the folder Cian_Belton_19321726_COMP47350_Homework1 you can find 
Cian's submission for Homework 1 which we used as inspiration for cleaning
our dataset in this Homework. There is also a Data Quality Report and Plan from
Homework1 in this folder, and a folder where charts are stored when the notebook runs.

- Next is the Homework2 Notebook which Cian and Shuya worked on. This is the main
notebook for this assignment as it contains our code and analysis for training and 
evaluating prediction models on our merged Covid-19 datasets.

- merged_data.csv is Cian's and Shuya's combined datasets from Homework1

- cleaned_merged_data.csv is our cleaned and merged datasets that we used in exercises 2-4.

- decision_tree.png is an image included in the Homework2 notebook that helps explain
how random forest works.

- random_forest.png is also an image included in the Homework2 notebook that helps explain
how random forest works.

- linear_regression_outliers.png is an image included in the Homework2 notebook that helps illustrate
the effect that outliers have on linear regression models.

- logistic_regression_outliers.png is an image included in the Homework2 notebook that helps illustrate
the limited effect that outliers have on logistic regression models.

- Finally requirements.txt is the file which lists all the packages that we  used for our homework,
 one package per line.
